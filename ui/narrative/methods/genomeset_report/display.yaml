    <p>This intended purpose of this App is to produce downloadable <b>TEXT</b> reports.</p>

    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of viewable HTML table, either as output from an App or by dragging the object onto the Narrative. This App serves a different purpose. It creates data files that are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or informatic scripts.</p>

    <p>This App creates reports on the Genomes in a GenomeSet. Short reports will display as TEXT in the “Summary” section of the output. Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab. There is a link for downloading the files in the “Files” section of the outout. Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may appear misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>

    <p><b>Inputs:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The KBase GenomeSet object.</li>
      <li>A download option:
        <ul>
          <li>Metadata: Minimal information. A report on the metadata for the GenomeSet, including, name, object type, author/creator, narrative ID, GenomeSet description, and a list of the KBase-relevant Genome IDs in the set.</li>
          <li>Vertical. List information on each of the Genomes in a vertical report instead of columns. Easy-to-read format but more difficult to visually compare one Genome to the others.</li>
          <li>Tab-delimited. A report with tab-delimited columns.</li>
          <li>Comma-delimited. A report with comma-delimited columns.</li>
          <li>DNA Fasta. A report with the DNA FASTA of each of the Genomes. NOTE: this is really long.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>Output:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>The <b>Summary</b> or <b>Link</b> section has a text version of the requested file.</li>
      <li>One downloadable file in the <b>Files</b> section. The name and content of the file will depend on the requested file format.
        <ol>
          <li>The metadata contains minimum information about the set and the genome references that are part of the set.</li>
          <li>FASTA files will be in FASTA format. The file name will end in .fna for nucleotide files and .faa for amino acid files.</li>
          <li>The other reports contain summary statistics about the genomes in the set. The differences are just in the format of the information.</li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol>
