    <p>This intended purpose of this App is to produce downloadable <b>TEXT</b> reports.</p>

    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of viewable HTML table, either as output from an App or by dragging the object onto the Narrative. This App serves a different purpose. This App creates data files that are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or informatic scripts.</p>

    <p>This App creates reports on the contents of an Assembly object. Short reports will display as TEXT in the Summary section of the output. Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new HTML browser tab. There will be a link for downloading the files in the Files section of the output. Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may appear misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>

    <p>The inputs are:
    <ul>
      <li>The KBase Assembly object (uploaded or output from an app)</li>
      <li>A checkbox for whether or not to include the FASTA of the Assembly object</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The outputs are:
    <ol>
      <li>A <b>Link</b> section with a link to the requested report that can be opened in another browser tab.</li>
      <li>One downloadable file in the <b>Files</b> section. The report has the following sections:
        <ol>
          <li>The metadata of the Assembly object. This includes the length of the DNA sequence, the number of contigs, the fraction GC content, a taxon reference, and a FASTA handle reference.</li>
          <li>A count of the As, Cs, Gs, and Ts in the Assembly</li>
          <li>A list of the contigs in the Assembly
            <ul>
              <li>Contig name (e.g., AKKW01000148)</li>
              <li>Length of the contig</li>
              <li>GC fraction of the contig</li>
              <li>Number of Ns</li>
              <li>Contig ID (can be the same as the name)</li>
              <li>Contig description from the FASTA header line</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>OPTIONALLY: the DNA of the contigs in FASTA format.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
