    <p>This intended purpose of this App is to produce downloadable <b>TEXT</b> reports.</p>

    <p>Most KBase data objects already have some type of viewable HTML table, either as output from an App or by dragging the object onto the Narrative. This App serves a different purpose. It creates data files that are downloadable and used with local tools such as Excel or informatic scripts.</p>

    <p>This App creates reports on a Genome. Short reports will display as TEXT in the “Summary” section of the output. Longer reports will instead have a link to open the TEXT in a new html browser tab. There is a link for downloading the file in the “Files” section of the output. Whether short or long, the Summary/Link section is intended to be a preview of the downloadable file. If the report is tab or comma delimited, it may appear misaligned on the screen but readable by a computer script.</p>

    <p><b>Inputs:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The KBase Genome object.</li>
      <li>A download option:
        <ul>
          <li>DNA FASTA format. Create a FASTA file of the genomic DNA.</li>
          <li>Features, Tab-delimited. A report where the rows are the genes in the Genome and the columns are information about the genes. Columns are separated with tabs.</li>
          <li>Features, Comma-delimited. A report where the rows are the genes in the Genome and the columns are information about the genes. Columns are separated with commas.</li>
          <li>Features, GFF3 format. A GFF3 (General Feature Format) file of the genes in the Genome.</li>
          <li>FASTA, translated CDSs. A FASTA-formatted file of the amino acid sequences of the genes.</li>
          <li>FASTA, of mRNAs. A FASTA-formatted file of the mRNA sequences of the genes.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>Output:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>The <b>Summary</b> or <b>Link</b> section has text version of the requested file.</li>
      <li>One downloadable file in the <b>Files</b> section. The name and content of the file will depend on the requested file format.
        <ol>
          <li>FASTA files will be in FASTA format. The file name will end in .fna for nucleotide files and .faa for amino acid files.</li>
          <li>Feature lists will include the FeatureID, Feature Type, Contig, Location (Feature Coordinates), Strand, Feature Function, and, if applicable, Aliases. Tab-delimited, comma-delimited, and GFF files will end in .tab, .csv and .gff, respectively.</li>
        </ol></li>
